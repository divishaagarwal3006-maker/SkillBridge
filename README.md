# SkillBridge

A working starter version of SkillBridge — a platform matching students with
small real tasks posted by companies, so students earn proof of skill
(ratings + certificates) instead of just a degree.

**Stack:** Python (Flask) backend · SQLite database · HTML/CSS/JS frontend.

## Features included
- Student & company signup/login (separate account types)
- Companies can post tasks (title, description, required skill, payment)
- Students browse/filter tasks by skill, with "matches your skills" highlighting
- Students apply to tasks
- Companies accept/reject applicants, then rate completed work
- Student profile auto-tracks average rating from completed tasks
- Responsive, dark-navy themed UI matching the original pitch deck

## Setup

1. **Install Python** (3.9+) if you don't have it already.

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **(Optional) Seed some demo data:**
```bash
   python seed.py
```
   This creates 2 demo companies with 4 tasks, and 1 demo student
   (login: `divisha@example.com` / `password123`).

5. **Run the app:**
```bash
   python app.py
```

6. Open **http://127.0.0.1:5000** in your browser.

## How the skill matching works
A simple exact-match check (case-insensitive) between a student's listed
skills and a task's required skill. This mirrors the "Skill-based task
matching algorithm" concept, implemented in Python. Extendable later for
partial matches, synonyms, or weighted scoring.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- In-app chat between student and company
- Skill badges (Gold, Silver, Bronze tiers) based on ratings
- Public leaderboard and student portfolio showcase
- File upload for task submissions instead of text notes
- AI-powered task recommendations for students
- Certificate generation (PDF) for highly rated work
- Payment gateway integration for paid tasks
- Mobile app version (iOS & Android)
- Deploy backend on Render/Railway (GitHub Pages can't run Python)
